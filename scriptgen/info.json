Currently, I use it to generate scripts from TV shows but you can use any model made with aitextgen! You can configure cooldowns and also cost per word generated! Cooldowns are for the entire server as not to stress the bot with multiple generations at once. A global lock can be configured such that the bot can only generate 1 text at a time.",
